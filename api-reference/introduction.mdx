## Welcome to Dev Kit for AI API

The Dev Kit for AI API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for building AI-powered web applications. Our API enables you to manage user authentication, projects, API keys, and AI-powered image generation.

## Base URLs

The API is available on multiple servers. You can select your preferred server in the API playground:

- **DevKit4AI**: `https://api.devkit4ai.com`
- **VibeCoding**: `https://api.vibecoding.ad`

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your access token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

To obtain an access token, use the [Login](/api-reference/auth/login) endpoint with your credentials. The token must be included in subsequent API requests.

For project-specific operations, you can also use API keys created through the [Project Management](/api-reference/projects/create-api-key) endpoints.
